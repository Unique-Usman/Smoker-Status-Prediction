# Impact of Smoking on Dental Health

This study examines the impact of smoking on dental health, focusing on its relationship with the prevalence of dental caries and periodontal disease. By analyzing data on smoking status (smoker, non-smoker, former smoker, passive smoker) and dental health indicators, the study aims to identify predictors of increased risk for dental issues among smokers. The findings will contribute to improved public health strategies, preventive care, and patient awareness of smoking’s effects on oral health.

## Objectives

- **Primary Goal**: To analyze the relationship between smoking and dental health outcomes.
- **Specific Goals**:
  - Identify predictors of dental caries and periodontal disease among smokers.
  - Guide public health initiatives and preventive strategies.
  - Enhance awareness of smoking's impact on oral health.

## Proposed Analytical Approaches

1. **Descriptive Statistics**  
   - Summarize smoking status and dental health indicators to provide an overview of the population.  

2. **T-tests and One-Way ANOVA**  
   - Compare dental health outcomes (e.g., DMFT scores) across different smoking categories (smokers, non-smokers, etc.).  

3. **Post-Hoc Tests (Tukey’s Test)**  
   - Identify specific differences between groups if ANOVA results are significant.  

4. **Chi-Squared Test**  
   - Analyze the association between smoking status and the presence of dental caries or periodontal disease.  

5. **Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis**  
   - Estimate time to the first incidence of dental caries, comparing smokers and non-smokers.  

6. **Cox Proportional Hazards Regression**  
   - Assess the risk of dental caries in smokers while controlling for factors such as age and gender.  

7. **ROC Curve and AUC**  
   - Evaluate the predictive accuracy of the regression model in identifying dental caries risk based on smoking status.

## Significance

This study's outcomes are critical for:  
- **Public Health Strategies**: Informing policies to address smoking-related dental health issues.  
- **Preventive Care**: Guiding dentists and healthcare providers in targeting at-risk groups.  
- **Patient Awareness**: Educating individuals about the oral health risks associated with smoking.
